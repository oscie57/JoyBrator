## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

DISCLAIMER: To avoid injury or aggravation of pre-existing conditions,
the vibrating remote should not be used on swollen or inflamed areas

the use of this software. Vibrating your remote for a long period of
time may (and probably will) damage the motor. Please be careful
and take breaks in between use to ensure safety of the HD rumble.
